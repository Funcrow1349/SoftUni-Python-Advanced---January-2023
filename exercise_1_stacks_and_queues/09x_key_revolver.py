# Our favorite super-spy action hero Sam is back from his vacation, and it is time to go on a mission. He needs to
# unlock a safe locked by several locks in a row, which all have varying sizes.The hero possesses a special weapon
# called the Key Revolver, with special bullets. Each bullet can unlock a lock with a size equal to or larger than the
# size of the bullet. The bullet goes into the keyhole, then explodes, completely destroying it. Sam doesn't know the
# size of the locks, so he needs to just shoot at all of them until the safe runs out of locks. What's behind the safe,
# you ask? Well, intelligence! It is told that Sam's sworn enemy – Nikoladze, keeps his top-secret Georgian Chacha
# Brandy recipe inside. It's valued differently across different times of the year, so Sam's boss will tell him what
# it's worth over the radio. One last thing, every bullet Sam fires will also cost him money, which will be deducted
# from his pay from the price of the intelligence.
# Good luck, operative!
# Input
#   •	On the first line of input, you will receive the price of each bullet – an integer in the range [0-100]
#   •	On the second line, you will receive the size of the gun barrel – an integer in the range [1-5000]
#   •	On the third line, you will receive the bullets – a space-separated integer sequence with [1-100] integers
#   •	On the fourth line, you will receive the locks – a space-separated integer sequence with [1-100] integers
#   •	On the fifth line, you will receive the value of the intelligence – an integer in the range [1-100000]
# After Sam receives all of his information and gear (input), he starts to shoot the locks front-to-back while going
# through the bullets back-to-front.If he successfully destroyed a lock, print "Bang!", then remove the lock. If not,
# print "Ping!", leaving the lock intact. The bullet is removed in both cases.If Sam runs out of bullets in his barrel,
# print "Reloading!" on the console, then continue shooting. If there aren't any bullets left, don't print it.
# The program ends when Sam runs out of bullets or the safe runs out of locks.
# Output
#   •	If Sam manages to open the safe, print:
#       "{bullets_left} bullets left. Earned ${money_earned}"
#   •	Otherwise, print:
#       "Couldn't get through. Locks left: {locks_left}"
# Make sure to include the price of the bullets when calculating the money earned.
# Constraints
#   •	The input will be within the constraints specified above and will always be valid.
#       There is no need to check it explicitly.
#   •	There will never be a case where Sam breaks the lock and ends up with а negative balance.
